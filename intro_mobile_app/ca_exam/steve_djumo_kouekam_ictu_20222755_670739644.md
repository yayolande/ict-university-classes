## Project's Architecture

At first, the **MVP pattern** was a consideration, however after much thinking, the project followed a **MVC pattern** instead. The main issue with the former pattern is that it was time consuming to properly implement since it would have required many *Presenter* for each *View*.

Furthermore, **MVC pattern** is extremely flexible, so if some code change further down the line, this architecture can easily adapt to the new requirements.
