## Project Repository

To find this project, go to this [github repository](https://github.com/yayolande/logbook-app).

This project was made by **Steve Djumo - ICTU 2022 27 55** at *ICT University* during the *Fall 2022* semester.

## Project Description

The project is a **Logbook System** to monitor a vehicle's fleet. It is made of 2 main actors:

* **The Driver**: He use the mobile app. That app stays in the vehicle and logs any car movement. To legally start a ride, the driver must enter his credential, and once done, the logistic officer is notified and then the app records data from the trip/ride (GPS localization, vehicle mileage, etc).
* **The Logistic Officer**: He use a desktop or mobile app. His role is to monitor all the ongoing vehicle movement using the built-in reporting tools and notification system.

## Project Progression

Due to the complex nature of the system, only the **mobile app for driver** is available. That app only implement basic functionality, and in a near future will have further features.
