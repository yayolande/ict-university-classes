## Section B

### 1. Chosen Topic

For this codelab, I chose to use **Java & JavaFX** as the main language.
The major reason being that *Java* is cross-platform, I was familiar with the language.

### 2. Project Architecture

Since there is a **GUI** for the application, a **MVC architectural pattern** will make the project more robust to change, and speed development further down the path.

### 3. Database Selection

First, the only database database table will be the **Employee table**.

Second, To make the deployment of the project seamless to others testers, developers, and reviewers, a database that require minimal installation is preferred. Thus, following those requirement, the best database that match this criterion is **SQLite**.

**SQLite**, being a simple 'text' file, do not necessitate the installation of a server on the client computer.
