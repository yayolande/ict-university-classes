## How pdf are created

Every pdf file start as a markdown first. Once all the text and assets are gathered and fused into the markdown file, I compile everyting from `.md` to `.pdf` using the **VS Code extension, Markdown PDF**. They other alternative such as **pandoc**, but I yet come around to use it on this repo.
